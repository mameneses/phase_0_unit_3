### Reflection ###

I found SQL to be interesting and the quizzes to be helpful. I have always
enjoyed more hands on work such as the tutorials and quizzes
really helped my understanding of SQL and made for good practice. I
struggled with some of the more advanced concepts in the join section
when trying to 'count' and 'sort by'.
