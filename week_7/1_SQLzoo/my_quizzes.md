### Reflection ###

I found SQL to be interesting at the quizzes to be fun. I have always
enjoyed more hands on work and working through the tutorials and quizzes
really helped my understanding of SQL and made for good practice. I
struggled with some of the more advanced concepts in the join section
when trying to 'count' and 'sort by'. While not incredibly difficult 
these seem to be essential skills to have when working in tech.
