## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: In my first schema, it is a many to many schema where I am modeling music artists and their songs. where they are many artisits that can have many songs.

Description of what you're modeling: In this second schema i am modeling a soccer club where there is one soccer club with one name, mascot, owner and coach. and i am connecting it to one coach because typiclly football clubs have one head coach, and the head coach is only head coach of that one team.

## Release 5: Reflection
I found this exercise to be interesting. It seemed like a very simple introduction to schema, but i also feel like it may be an over simplification and i would still have issues grasping more complex database schemas. I enjoy that it is a very logical connecting of databases, which make it easier to understand. Like everything, i think more examples of differnt types would really help to solidify my understanding.
